# Closest Pair Algorithm Parallelization for High Performance Computing

● Parallelized the well-known Closest Pair algorithm for 2-Dimensional Plane using C++, OpenMp and multi-threading. It was
developed to understand the nearest vehicles to predict and prevent a collision from happening.

● Took benefit of the divide-conquer approach and parallelized the unrelated sub-area processing to achieve higher speedup.
